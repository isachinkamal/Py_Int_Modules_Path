# Natural Language Testing Framework (NLTF)

## Framework Components

### NLPreprocessor: Handles text cleaning and normalization
- **Text cleaning** (lowercase, punctuation removal, etc.)
- **Tokenization**
- **Stopword removal**
- **Stemming and lemmatization**

### NLFeatureExtractor: Converts text to numerical features
- **Bag-of-words representation**
- **TF-IDF vectors** (requires external vectorizer)
- **Word embeddings** (requires pre-trained model)

### NLTestSuite: Manages and executes test cases
- Add test cases with expected outputs
- Run tests against models
- Generate detailed reports

### NLEvaluator: Provides evaluation metrics
- **Classification metrics** (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)
- **Text similarity measures** (Jaccard, cosine, Levenshtein)

## Example Usage

The example demonstrates testing a simple sentiment analysis model with three test cases. The framework:

1. Processes each test input
2. Compares model output with expected results
3. Provides detailed pass/fail information
4. Calculates overall accuracy

## Extending the Framework

To extend this framework for specific NLP tasks:

### For text classification:
- Add more test cases covering edge cases
- Include metrics like ROC-AUC for probabilistic outputs

### For named entity recognition:
- Add sequence comparison utilities
- Include metrics like token-level accuracy

### For machine translation:
- Add BLEU score calculation
- Include semantic similarity measures

### For question answering:
- Add exact match and F1 score calculations
- Include context understanding tests

This framework provides a solid foundation that can be adapted to various natural language processing testing scenarios.
